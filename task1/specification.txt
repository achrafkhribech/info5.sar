Overview
The communication system consists of three main abstract classes: Broker, Channel, and Task. This system is designed to handle multithreaded communication between different components using channels, with brokers managing the channels and tasks interacting with brokers.

Broker: Represents a network broker that manages communication channels. It can accept incoming connections and establish outgoing connections, allowing multiple channels to be created.
Channel: Represents a communication channel used for data transfer. It supports reading and writing data, as well as managing the connection state.
Task: Represents a task that can execute in a separate thread. Each task is associated with a broker and can access it.
Specification
Broker Class
Purpose: Manages communication channels, allowing for incoming and outgoing connections.

Multithreading Consideration:
The Broker class must be thread-safe. Since multiple tasks or threads may try to accept or connect to different channels simultaneously, all methods that modify or access shared resources must be synchronized to avoid race conditions.

Constructor:

Broker(String name): Initializes the broker with a name.
Methods:

Channel accept(int port): Accepts incoming connections on the specified port and returns a channel. Multiple channels can be accepted concurrently.
Thread-Safety Note: This method must be synchronized to handle concurrent connection attempts.

Channel connect(String name, int port): Connects to a remote broker identified by name at the given port and returns a channel.
Thread-Safety Note: This method should be synchronized to ensure that multiple threads can establish connections safely.

Channel Class
Purpose: Represents a communication channel for reading and writing data, and managing connection state.

Multithreading Consideration:
Each channel instance is generally associated with a single connection. However, if multiple threads share a channel (e.g., one for reading and another for writing), access to the channel must be properly synchronized to prevent data corruption.

Methods:

int read(byte[] bytes, int offset, int length): Reads data from the channel into the provided byte array.
Thread-Safety Note: Synchronize access if the same channel is shared between threads for reading.

int write(byte[] bytes, int offset, int length): Writes data from the byte array to the channel.
Thread-Safety Note: Synchronize access if the same channel is shared between threads for writing.

void disconnect(): Disconnects the channel and releases resources.
Thread-Safety Note: Synchronize this method to prevent multiple threads from disconnecting a channel at the same time.

boolean disconnected(): Checks if the channel is disconnected. This method may not need synchronization if it's read-only, but ensure that it doesn't conflict with other operations on the channel.

Task Class
Purpose: Represents a task that runs in a separate thread and interacts with a broker.

Multithreading Consideration:
Each task runs on its own thread, but tasks may share brokers and channels. Care must be taken to ensure that tasks donâ€™t cause race conditions when accessing shared resources like the broker or a channel.

Constructor:

Task(Broker b, Runnable r): Initializes the task with a broker and a runnable task. The Runnable provides the logic for the task to execute.
Methods:

static Broker getBroker(): Retrieves the broker associated with the current task.
Thread-Safety Note: Ensure that this method returns the correct broker in a multithreaded environment, particularly if tasks may be reassigned or share brokers.
Additional Notes:
Shared Resources: When sharing resources (such as a broker or channel) between tasks, ensure that appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., synchronized methods or locks) are in place to prevent race conditions.

Concurrency: Since a broker can handle multiple channels, developers should design tasks with concurrency in mind. One broker is enough to establish multiple channels for incoming or outgoing connections, allowing multiple simultaneous communications.

Deadlock Prevention: Developers should ensure that the design of tasks and channel usage avoids deadlock situations where tasks wait indefinitely for resources locked by other tasks.
